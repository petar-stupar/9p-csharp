# Fetch Ticket via MCP — 9p-csharp

Fetch the ticket at the URL or ID provided in $ARGUMENTS using your available MCP tools.

**Steps:**
1. Use the MCP tool for the appropriate ticketing system (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues,
   Notion, or Azure DevOps). Prefer the official MCP server for the system. If no MCP
   server is available, STOP IMMEDIATELY and inform the user that they need to configure
   an appropriate MCP server for their ticketing system or copy the ticket contents
   manually into the ticket.md file.
2. Collect: title, description, all comments (with author names and timestamps), any
   linked resources, and attachment summaries.
3. For each linked resource, record its URL and title. If an MCP server is configured
   for the resource's service (e.g. Figma, Google Docs/Drive, SharePoint, Confluence,
   Miro), use it to read the resource — then write a concise description of what it
   contains and how it relates to this ticket. Do NOT dump raw content; summarise only
   what is relevant to understanding the ticket's requirements.
4. Write the following files to .qode/contexts/current/, creating the directory if needed:
   - ticket.md — title, description, metadata
   - ticket-comments.md — all comments in chronological order (omit if no comments)
   - ticket-links.md — linked resources with summaries or fetched content (omit if no links)
5. Report a one-line summary: "Fetched: <title> — <N> comments, <M> links."
