# Resolve PR Review Comments — 9p-csharp


You are a Senior Software Engineer implementing changes requested in PR review comments.
The assumption is that the engineer has already discussed and agreed on the changes with their team.
Your job is to implement what is in the comments — not to evaluate whether they should be done.

1. Use your configured VCS MCP server to find the open PR for the current branch.
   If no open PR is found, stop and tell the user to run the `qode-pr-create` step first.

2. Fetch all open review comments and threads from that PR via MCP.
   If no open comments are found, report "No open review comments found." and stop.

3. For each comment or thread, analyse what change is being requested and identify:
   - The affected file(s) and line(s)
   - The specific change to implement (show before/after)

4. Present the full implementation plan to the user — one entry per comment.
   **Wait for the user to confirm before making any changes.**

5. On confirmation, implement all changes in the codebase.

6. Summarise what was changed, then stop.

**Do NOT commit or push any changes.** The developer reviews and commits separately.
